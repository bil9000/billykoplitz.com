The rest fo the exchanges are either something-coin or coin-something like "foocoin" or "coinbazz".  Kraken has a little more style.   They are also the most secure publicly accessible website that i hav ever seen. Of course that assumes that you, the user are following best practices as well.</p><p>"Wait, why is this post entitled 'Karl Popper'."</p><p>I'm getting there, don't worry, there is a dog on the runway so we can't land yet, but the ground personnel  have a frisbee and will get him off.  We have plenty of fuel so relax. Actually I just realized that I am procrastinating like a champion.  </p><p>Every day Kraken sends out their Daily Intelligence Report and it starts with a quote and then talks about they usual things like who is buying whom, or what the Federal Reserve is doing.  The ordinary.</p><p>I have been keeping a list of my favorite quotes and this is the one from yesterday, it made my Top Ten List of Awesome Quotes from the Kraken Intelligence Briefing -- I'lll wordsmith that title into some incredible clickbait someday.</p><p>Here it is:</p><blockquote><p>"Optimism is a duty. The future is open. It is not predetermined. No one can predict it, except by chance. We all contribute to determining it by what we do. We are all equally responsible for its success."<br><i>― Karl Popper</i></p></blockquote><p>That's it.  I don't know why exactly but that first sentence just pokes me in the heart.  Perhaps I've been feeling less than optimistic about some things. All of them too wildly personal to put on the internet.   But the fact of it being a duty, an obligation to be optimistic made me actually away of how I had been failing the people around me and myself, by being sub-optimistic. So enough of that. </p><p>But how cool was Karl Popper?  I hadn't really heard much about him until I read Nassim Taleb's books "The Black Swan" and "Antifragile".  Mr. Taleb who doesn't have a whole lot of use for much of modern philosophy or traditional financial advisers models - is clearly a huge fan of Karl Popper.  </p><p>And now to figure out where to start.  Philosophy books are tricky because I want to read his "greatest hits" at the risk of sounding click-bait-y but also want to get a general sense of the scope and sweep of his work.  Recommendations are welcome. :)</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 27, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://billykoplitz.com/authors/billy-koplitz/" class="invert" rel="author">billy koplitz</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://billykoplitz.com/lookee-here.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> lookee here</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>&amp;copy;</p><p> </p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
