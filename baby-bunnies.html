She was obviously a female (or a "doe"), since the guy (or a "buck") who had been chasing her was a lot bigger and expressed some serious amorous interest.</p><p>She didn't seem to interested and he was literally chasing her around yesterday.</p><p>About a week ago she had made a nest under a lawn chair, which had been subsequently moved, and I thought she had abandoned her nest.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/bunny.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/responsive/bunny-xs.jpg 300w, https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/responsive/bunny-sm.jpg 480w, https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/responsive/bunny-md.jpg 768w, https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/responsive/bunny-lg.jpg 1024w, https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/responsive/bunny-xl.jpg 1360w, https://billykoplitz.com/media/posts/7/responsive/bunny-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1515" height="1531"></figure><h5>Here is a photo of her under the slackline, looking wary, as rabbits usually do.</h5><p>So she was hanging around and doing some pretty bizarre stuff. As is document by myself and Amy in our not-quite-National-Geograpic-level commentary.</p><p>Following is the commentary as the situation unfolded. She gave birth to three healthy looking baby bunnies!!! (Which by the way are called "kits" or "kittens", thanks Wikipedia)</p><p>They are so freakin' cute, it was unbelievable! Mom was a champ. She didn't get scared of us, or the Orkin man who was inspecting for termites. The Orkin man, though he was trying to be tough, I mean he is a killer by trade, also took out his camera and took pictures.</p><p>I don't have an update yet. She seems to have taken off to go to hair salon to tell the girls about her new babies and left them in a little fur-lined nest. I'm sure she has come back by now, but I do worry about the teensy tiny baby rabbits. I sure hope they are ok.</p><p>Amy erected a protective barrier using a beach chair, and I'm keeping an ear out for the sounds of lawn mowers. I also put some salad greens in a bowl in case she comes back and is hungry. I washed them off and made sure there was no bacon in the salad.</p><p>I've included the sequence of videos. I hope you enjoy them.</p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OsuA_iCXtw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5E1-mCHIfj0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcOduKcyN7U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAHtTORrDV8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsxDVsqSgh0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></section></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 27, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://billykoplitz.com/authors/billy-koplitz/" class="invert" rel="author">billy koplitz</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://billykoplitz.com/habit.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> habit</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://billykoplitz.com/nothing-is-fixed.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> nothing is fixed </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>&amp;copy;</p><p>Â </p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
