just a personal website, nothing fancy

it was created using publii because the software i was using, cactus for mac, fell out of maintenance. i started to look at the code and quickly decided to use another product.

this should serve as an indictment of the people who wrote the original cactus, i am actually a big fan, but there was a lot of stuff i didn't want to upgrade to get the package working again.  some fiddly django stuff.
