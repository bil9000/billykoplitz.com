There is suffering. I mean, life is beautiful, but there is a whole lot of pain going around. I hope that this gets easier for everyone. There is something about the zeitgeist right now which is just unsettled.</li><li>The slower I go, the more I enjoy life. I don’t mean doing nothing by accident. Not spending idle time flipping through websites. But actually being present in what is happening to me — right now, right here.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There is no point to what I am writing.

Instead of trading time for money, I am going to try and be more of service to others.</p><blockquote>There’s an old Zen story: a student said to Master Ichu, “Please write for me something of great wisdom.” Master Ichu picked up his brush and wrote one word: “Attention.” The student said, “Is that all?” The master wrote, “Attention. Attention.” The student became irritable. “That doesn’t seem profound or subtle to me.” In response, Master Ichu wrote simply, “Attention. Attention. Attention.” In frustration, the student demanded, “What does this word ‘attention’ mean?” Master Ichu replied, “Attention means attention.” ~<a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/attention-means-attention/">Charlotte Joko Beck</a></blockquote></section><footer id="post-meta" class="clearfix"><div>Posted on Mar 8</div></footer></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 27, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://billykoplitz.com/authors/billy-koplitz/" class="invert" rel="author">billy koplitz</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://billykoplitz.com/hello-world.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> hello world.</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://billykoplitz.com/dont-look-at-the-trees.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> don&#x27;t look at the trees </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>&amp;copy;</p><p> </p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://billykoplitz.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
